# BYGAY
My first program in c++

**ByGay** is a Roblox spoofer developed in **C++**. It allows manipulating the user identity or connection when interacting with Roblox, useful for testing and analysis. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to violate Roblox's terms of service or engage in any malicious activity.

## üöÄ Features

- **Identity Spoofing**: Allows you to change the user's identity when connecting to Roblox.
- **Bypass Security Checks**: Interacts with certain Roblox security checks for penetration testing purposes.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple and fast to use via the terminal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed before starting:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC or MSVC)
- **CMake** (for build management)

## üîß Installation

If you're using the pre-compiled `.exe` file, skip the compilation step and proceed with the following:

### 1. Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bygay.git
cd bygay
```

### 2. (Optional) Install Dependencies

If you want to build the project from source, install the necessary dependencies:

- **Windows**: `vcpkg` or **MSYS2**
- **Linux/Mac**: Use `apt-get` or `brew` to install required libraries.

### 3. Build the Project (if needed)

Use **CMake** to generate the build files:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 4. Running the Spoofer

Once compiled, or if you're using the `.exe` build, you can run the spoofer from the command line:

```bash
./bygay.exe  # Or simply run ByGay.exe on Windows
```

## üìù Usage

1. Launch the program via the terminal (or run the `.exe` directly).
2. Enter the User ID you'd like to spoof.
3. Enjoy using the spoofer during your Roblox session.

**Warning**: This program is intended for testing purposes only and can be detected by Roblox. Use it only in a controlled environment and avoid violating Roblox's terms of service.
